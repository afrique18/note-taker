# note-taker

## Description

The goal of this assignment is to modify a given starter code to create a web-based application called Note Taker, that allows users to write and save notes. The application is built using Express.js as the back end and stores the note data in a JSON file. The application provides a user-friendly interface for creating, viewing, and deleting notes. The applicationâ€™s front end has already been created. I was then tasked with building the back end, and connect the two, and then deploy the entire application to Heroku for easy accessibility.
